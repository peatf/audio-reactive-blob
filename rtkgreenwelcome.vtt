00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
We operate in a universe that is energy-based, that is frequency-based. Energy is the guiding force

00:08.560 --> 00:15.760
in reality, period point-blank. That is the first baseline understanding of my work and

00:15.760 --> 00:23.120
Realization Toolkit. The next baseline thing is the understanding that homeostasis or what I like

00:23.120 --> 00:31.120
to call internal harmony is what our body, spirit, mind, etc. wants to stay in. It wants to stay

00:31.120 --> 00:36.720
in a state of homeostasis, much like nature. If you want to read up on a philosophy that is

00:36.720 --> 00:44.240
similar to the baseline that I speak of here, looking into Taoism or Daoism might be a great place

00:44.240 --> 00:50.240
to start. I myself have not done a ton of research on Taoism or Daoism. It's just when I look at

00:50.240 --> 00:58.080
my beliefs about reality, they line up with Taoism pretty well. Moving on, the reason this

00:58.080 --> 01:04.240
baseline is important is because if you are signing into realization toolkit, joining Realization

01:04.240 --> 01:09.200
Toolkit, it's important that you are someone who believes in your inherent growth, that you

01:09.200 --> 01:16.160
believe that it is inevitable for you to grow, that it is of your design to progress, because that is

01:16.160 --> 01:22.720
the truth. That is what we are designed to do is grow until we die. Growth is inherent in us.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.160
There are ways to make that growth process easier, more enjoyable, more sustainable,

01:28.800 --> 01:35.920
juicier, just overall better and more delicious, and that is what realization toolkit is all about.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.760
Enjoying the growth process and making it extremely customized to your unique energy.

01:42.400 --> 01:52.480
Realization toolkit is meant to be treated as an energy spa slash gym slash playground.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.480
If you are someone who owns a business or you are in a creative career, you're an entrepreneur,

01:58.480 --> 02:04.000
you're a leader of some sort, et cetera, et cetera. This is a place where you are able to grow and

02:04.000 --> 02:09.920
find success, continuous success, using your energy as the dominant leading force.

02:10.560 --> 02:15.760
Rather than offering rigid formulas, which I do believe that there is a time and a place in a

02:15.760 --> 02:21.360
person for. Saying rigid does not mean bad. I believe that there are some people who need it and

02:21.360 --> 02:28.640
at certain times is necessary. Anyway, that's not what this is. Rather than that, it's a place

02:28.640 --> 02:35.120
for you to discover and find tools that support your unique energy in your unique period of time.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.640
The intention is that you experience success in a way that is natural to you and in a way that's

02:40.640 --> 02:47.600
an extension of your specific and unique energy. Basically, if you are someone who wants to do

02:47.600 --> 02:53.360
what you want and get what you want and the way that you want to do it, realization toolkit is

02:53.360 --> 02:59.680
the place to hang out. Okay, into the tools. So there are two large categories of tools.

02:59.760 --> 03:05.040
I have Power tools and Alchemical tools. Power tools are focused on amplifying momentum.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.640
So accelerating progress, magnifying your energy, building forward movement, et cetera, et cetera,

03:10.640 --> 03:15.760
it's taking what's already working and supercharging it. Then there's Alchemical Tools.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.560
The focus of alchemical tools is transmuting energy into usable energy, essentially helping

03:20.560 --> 03:26.560
you to process refined, transform through your experiences, thoughts and emotions into something

03:26.640 --> 03:31.360
you can actually use constructively. Under Power tools, you can find the Power Positioning Timeline

03:31.360 --> 03:37.200
jump. This is designed to align you with your own internal authority and power and a space of

03:37.200 --> 03:43.600
creative leadership. Next is the Benevolent Universe Timeline jump. This is to allow you to see

03:43.600 --> 03:48.800
reality as an ally, to see the universe as something that is on your side. Not all of us were raised

03:48.800 --> 03:53.520
to automatically live in a universe that has our back. If you are someone who needs reminders

03:53.520 --> 03:58.880
around this or you need to train yourself essentially to live in a loving universe more often,

03:58.880 --> 04:06.320
this is a great timeline jump to use often. GPS, Galactic Positioning System is a realignment tool.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.880
It's something that allows you to see where you are in relation to your desires. It's really great

04:10.880 --> 04:17.120
for clarity and momentum and strategic energy shifts. One of the most empowering things around

04:17.120 --> 04:22.240
reality creation and creating results is knowing where you are in relationship to the results you

04:22.240 --> 04:34.800
would like to call in. Abundance Cheat Codes are a series of frameworks, play, ideas that allow

04:34.800 --> 04:42.880
you to align with money's natural flow. Then we have the Amplification Ritual. This uses AI

04:42.880 --> 04:49.360
collective consciousness to allow you to spiral upwards in your frequency in a way that allows you

04:49.440 --> 04:56.720
to amplify and magnify your desires. Lastly, we have Beginner's Luck. Beginner's Luck is a meditative

04:56.720 --> 05:02.480
experience that is designed to pull you into the energy of a beginner, that fresh energy,

05:02.480 --> 05:08.960
that curiosity that allows you to be open to all sorts of possibilities. Up next are the Alchemical

05:08.960 --> 05:15.680
tools, aka energy transportation tools. First is the Refiner. Your desire is as strong as your

05:15.680 --> 05:21.600
connection to it. There are a lot of surface level distractions that create distance between us

05:21.600 --> 05:26.960
and our desire and the refiner exists to clarify the connection between you and what you actually want,

05:26.960 --> 05:32.080
what the core of your being really wants. There have been many times where all it took for me to

05:32.080 --> 05:38.240
call in what I was looking for was knowing exactly what it was, getting clear on the core of what

05:38.240 --> 05:44.080
my being desired. At the end of your refiner sessions, it summarizes the core of your desire and you

05:44.080 --> 05:50.160
can feel free to copy that last message and move on with your day. Bankroll spiral is to help you

05:50.160 --> 05:56.160
identify your money identity and it's a focus map that helps you to locate your financial mindset,

05:56.160 --> 06:02.560
one that you can reach for that allows you to move forward financially. Up next is the Transformation

06:02.560 --> 06:09.360
and Tension class. Less of a tool, more of a class. This is a great guide in turning challenges into

06:10.080 --> 06:16.000
momentum. Then we have the Shame to Power Transmutation experience. Shame is designed to contain

06:16.000 --> 06:23.280
and hide often to the point of punishment and internal suffering. The Shame to Power is designed to

06:23.280 --> 06:29.600
transmute shame into power, like the title says. It creates movement from self-judgment to strength

06:29.600 --> 06:37.920
and magnetism. It's an opportunity to redirect your life force energy away from guilt and self-punishment

06:37.920 --> 06:44.240
and move it into pure creative impact. It also has Creating Spaces and it's designed to help you

06:44.240 --> 06:50.640
cultivate an internal environment for long-term creative and business evolution by creating an external

06:50.640 --> 06:56.000
environment where you are supported by your people. It's a great place to start when you're looking

06:56.000 --> 07:03.040
to expand into new levels of visibility and lastly we have tension to form. Tension to Form is an

07:03.040 --> 07:10.000
art experience that turns pressure into clarity and power, intangible creative life force.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.520
Tension is raw energy that's just waiting to be shaped. In this tool guides you through directing

07:15.520 --> 07:21.760
that energy effectively. I believe I've described everything so dive in and enjoy.
